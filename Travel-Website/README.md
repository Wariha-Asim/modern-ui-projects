# JourneyMates Multi-Page Travel Website

A clean, responsive, multi-page travel website built with semantic HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and vanilla JavaScript.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home (hero, featured destinations, testimonials, footer)
- `about.html` — About (company info, team, mission)
- `contact.html` — Contact (form, details, embedded Google Map)
- `policies.html` — Policies (privacy, terms, cookies)

## Design
- Palette from ColorHunt: #B1F0F7, #81BFDA, #F5F0CD, #FADA7A
- Google Fonts: Poppins (headings), Roboto (body)
- Reusable navbar/footer on all pages
- Hover/focus states for accessibility

## Run Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

## Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages on the `main` branch (`/root`).
- Netlify: drag-and-drop the folder; set publish directory to the project root.
